    "text": "For this project, Exploring Female Representation in MoMA, my team and I designed a website exploring the underrepresentation of female artists in major art institutions, with a focus on the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Using the publicly available Artworks.csv dataset from MoMA’s GitHub repository—which includes information on artwork titles, artist demographics, acquisition dates, and exhibition status—we analyzed how female artist representation in MoMA has shifted over time for domestic and international artists. We created data visualizations in Tableau to illustrate these trends and contextualized our findings by drawing connections to key waves of feminist activism. My primary contributions included designing the website in WordPress, cleaning and preparing the dataset, and creating visualizations to communicate our insights."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this clinical study, The Effect of Caffeine and Exercise on Attention, I investigated whether caffeine intake and running distance significantly impact attention span using a 2-way factorial design with interactions. Both factors had three levels—caffeine (250mL green tea, 250mL coffee, 500mL coffee) and exercise (100m, 1km, 5km)—creating nine experimental groups. The study was conducted using The Island, an online simulation platform that allowed me to administer treatments and measure attention in simulated individuals. ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc tests revealed no statistically significant effect from caffeine, exercise, or their interaction on attention span, suggesting these variables do not meaningfully impact attentional performance in the context of this simulation."

After imputing missing values with random forest methods, we evaluated several classification models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Our final model, a random forest with 500 trees, achieved a testing accuracy of 99.943%. We also used correlation analysis and variable importance rankings to identify the most influential predictors, which included frequent consumption of high-calorie foods (FAVC), physical activity frequency (FAF), water intake (CH2O), number of main meals (NCP), and family history of being overweight."

    "text": "In Altadena and the Eaton Fire, my team and I developed an interactive website using ArcGIS StoryMaps to examine the disproportionate impacts of the 2023 Eaton Fire on historically marginalized communities in Altadena, California. The first half of our project uses spatial data—including Cal Fire’s Damage Inspection (DINS) reports, HOLC redlining maps, and U.S. Census data—to investigate how redlining and discriminatory housing policies have shaped present-day vulnerability to wildfire damage. The second half shifts to a more human-centered narrative, examining the fire’s impact on Altadena’s cultural landscape through the loss of historic landmarks, small businesses, and individual homes, many tied to long-standing Black and Latinx families. Together, these stories and spatial patterns reveal how past and present injustices shape who bears the brunt of climate disasters."

    "text": "In our project, The Social Soundscape: How Social Media Impacts Music Popularity, my team and I analyzed a dataset of over 4,000 songs with the highest Spotify streams in 2024, incorporating data from YouTube, TikTok, Apple Music, and other platforms. We explored three key questions: whether a song’s release month affects its popularity, how genre performance varies across platforms, and the relationship between TikTok engagement and Spotify streams. I led the data cleaning process and conducted the analysis for our first research question, using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon post-hoc comparisons after finding ANOVA assumptions were violated. We found that songs released in January saw significantly higher Spotify streams, likely due to seasonal trends. Our findings offer insights for artists and marketers on how timing and platform strategy can shape a song’s success in today’s algorithm-driven music landscape."

Using data from 980 students, we built logistic and linear regression models to examine how writing confidence and structural inequities affect placement results. We found that higher self-reported confidence reduced the need for a second evaluator, while underrepresented minority students were more likely to be placed in lower-level courses, pointing to potential disparities in the placement process."
