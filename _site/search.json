Using our research, we discussed potential connections between changes in gender representation in MoMA and feminist movements taking place at the same time.\n\n\n\nHow did waves of feminism and American social movements of the mid-1900s affect the representation of American female artists in the MoMA collection? \nBeyond the U.S., how did global feminist movements relate to the ethnic diversity of female artists in the MoMA collection?\n\n\n\n\nMy main responsibility in this project was web design through WordPress.
