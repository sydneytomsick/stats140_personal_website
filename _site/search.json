    "section": "",
    "text": "About\nMy team and I were provided with a training and testing dataset containing 29 predictors of obesity status capturing aspects such as dietary habits, physical activity, water consumption, and family medical history. The outcome variable “obesity status” classified individuals as either “Obese” or “Not Obese”. We were tasked with predicting obesity status for the testing dataset and determining the most influential predictors. Here is my written Report.\n\n\nMethods\nFirst, we imputed the data using random forests to fill in missing values. Then, we tried multiple models to predict obesity status such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Our random forests model with 500 trees performed best, with a testing prediction accuracy of 99.943%.\nWe then found the most influential predictors using correlation analysis (point-biserial and Cramer’s V correlation) and variable importance from the random forests model."

Our website compiles maps we created using ArcGIS and our narrative which discusses the history of discrimination within Altadena. To create our maps, we used various datasets such as the Cal Fire Damage Inspection (DINS) data, a layer within ArcGIS which shows how much damage each house and structure faced in the Eaton Fire. We also used HOLC grade data, the National Register of Historic Places, and US Census data.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nHow did the Eaton Fire damages affect homeowners in marginalized communities in Altadena, and what role did historical segregation policies play in shaping vulnerability to wildfire risks?\nHow did the Eaton Fire impact Altadena’s community both in terms of historical landmarks and cultural legacy? What does the loss of these spaces mean for the community’s future?"

    "text": "About\nMy team and I used this dataset with over 4000 observations. It contains the name, artist, album name, and release date of the songs with the most Spotify streams in 2024. It also contains the number of Spotify Streams, Youtube views, Youtube likes, TikTok views, and TikTok likes of each song, and information from other music streaming platforms (Apple music, Pandora, Soundcloud, etc.). You can find more information about each of the variables at this link. We used this dataset to answer the following research questions. Here is our Report and Poster.\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nDoes the release month of a song impact its popularity?\nAre certain genres of songs more popular on certain platforms?\nIs there a correlation between a song’s popularity on TikTok vs. Spotify?\n\n\n\nMy Role\nI was specifically responsible for cleaning the data and answering research question 1. I cleaned the data by removing duplicate observations, removing unnecessary columns, standardizing the release date column, adding a “Release.Month” column, ensuring each variable was the correct data type, and performing missing data imputation.\nFor research question 1, I checked the assumptions for ANOVA and found that the residuals were heavily skewed and did not follow a normal distribution. Therefore, I used the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test to evaluate whether at least one release month had a statistically different distribution of Spotify streams compared to others. For the post-hoc analysis, I used the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test with Bonferroni correction to evaluate which specific release months had a different distribution of Spotify Streams."

    "text": "About\nThis Statistical Analysis Paper was a client project for the UCLA English Department, which aimed to understand how self-assessments and demographic factors influence incoming students’ English placement outcomes. Using data from 980 students, we built logistic and linear regression models to examine how writing confidence and structural inequities affect placement results. We found that higher self-reported confidence reduced the need for a second evaluator, while underrepresented minority students were more likely to be placed in lower-level courses, pointing to potential disparities in the placement process."
