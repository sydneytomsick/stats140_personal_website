I designed and built [*The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) website*](https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/){style="color: blue;"} using WordPress. While the written and visual content (text, images, videos) was provided, I planned the site structure and layout to create a professional, user-friendly experience.

To enhance functionality and design, I incorporated custom HTML and CSS to develop a hero banner, a secondary sliding menu, and mobile-friendly styling across the site.
