### About 

This [**Statistical Analysis Paper**](A_Statistical_Analysis_of_the_Informed_Placement_Process__IPP__at_UCLA_Final copy.pdf){style="color: blue;"} was a client project for the UCLA English Department, which aimed to understand how self-assessments and demographic factors influence incoming students' English placement outcomes. Using data from 980 students, we built logistic and linear regression models to examine how writing confidence and structural inequities affect placement results. We found that higher self-reported confidence reduced the need for a second evaluator, while underrepresented minority students were more likely to be placed in lower-level courses, pointing to potential disparities in the placement process.
