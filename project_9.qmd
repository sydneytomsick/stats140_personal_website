I also created a series of [Tableau Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sydney.tomsick/viz/AAMDGraphs/NumberofMembershipsforFreeMuseums) for the Hammer Museum using a dataset of 100+ survey questions comparing the Hammer to peer institutions. I visualized each question, allowing quick benchmarking against other museums. I also built interactive filters, allowing the team to narrow comparisons by categories such as contemporary museums, university-affiliated museums, California-based museums, free admission museums, or museums with similar operating budgets.
