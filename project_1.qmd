For this project, [*Exploring Female Representation in MoMA*](https://exhibitexplorers.humspace.ucla.edu){style="color: blue;"}, my team and I designed a website exploring the underrepresentation of female artists in major art institutions, with a focus on the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York. Using the publicly available *Artworks.csv* dataset from MoMA’s GitHub repository—which includes information on artwork titles, artist demographics, acquisition dates, and exhibition status—we analyzed how female artist representation in MoMA has shifted over time for domestic and international artists. We created data visualizations in Tableau to illustrate these trends and contextualized our findings by drawing connections to key waves of feminist activism. My primary contributions included designing the website in WordPress, cleaning and preparing the dataset, and creating visualizations to communicate our insights.
