I conceptualized and designed "Snagged": an app for style-conscious thrifters who want to discover new thrift stores, rate and review their experiences, and share their journey with friends. My whole process of designing "Snagged" can be found on this [***website***](https://snaggeddesign.wordpress.com/){style="color: blue;"}; from user interviews and personas to wireframes and the final design.
