I am a fourth-year Statistics and Data Science major at UCLA with a minor in Digital Humanities. I'm passionate about uncovering meaningful insights through data analysis and communicating them through user-centered design. With interests spanning statistics, data science, UX design, and digital humanities, I enjoy working at the intersection of quantitative analysis and creative storytelling: translating complex data into accessible, engaging experiences across digital platforms. Outside of academic pursuits, I love to dance and am one of the directors of Synthesis Dance Theater, a dance club at UCLA.

I bring extensive experience in museum operations, with previous roles at both the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) and the Hammer Museum. At each institution, I worked at the front desk welcoming visitors, selling tickets and memberships, and completing administrative tasks. After a summer on the retail team at LHS, I was promoted to Assistant Manager, where I gained hands-on experience with marketing analytics and strategy. I tracked daily sales data, identified seasonal trends across multiple years, and used these insights to assess performance and inform decision-making. I also gathered and analyzed visitor feedback to advocate for changes. These experiences sparked my interest in using data to drive organizational improvements and motivated me to explore marketing analytics as a career.
