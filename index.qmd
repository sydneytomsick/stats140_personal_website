I’m a fourth-year Statistics and Data Science major at UCLA, with a minor in Digital Humanities. With a multidisciplinary background in data science, UX design, marketing, and arts administration, I am passionate about combining analytical thinking with creative storytelling to craft digital content and outreach strategies that resonate with people. Outside of academics, I’m a director of Synthesis Dance Theater, a student-run dance company at UCLA.
