In this team project, [***Predicting Obesity Status Based on Genetic and Lifestyle Factors***](Stats101C_Final_Paper.pdf){style="color: blue;"}, we aimed to predict individualsâ€™ obesity status using a dataset of 42,686 observations with 29 predictors spanning dietary habits, physical activity, water intake, and family history. After imputing missing values with random forest methods, we evaluated several classification models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Our final model, a random forest with 500 trees, achieved a testing accuracy of 99.943%. We also used correlation analysis and variable importance rankings to identify the most influential predictors, which included frequent consumption of high-calorie foods (FAVC), physical activity frequency (FAF), water intake (CH2O), number of main meals (NCP), and family history of being overweight.
