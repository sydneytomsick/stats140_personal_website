In our project, [*The Social Soundscape: How Social Media Impacts Music Popularity*](Stats140XP_FinalReport.pdf){style="color: blue;"}, my team and I analyzed a dataset of over 4,000 songs with the highest Spotify streams in 2024, incorporating data from YouTube, TikTok, Apple Music, and other platforms. We explored three key questions: whether a song’s release month affects its popularity, how genre performance varies across platforms, and the relationship between TikTok engagement and Spotify streams. I led the data cleaning process and conducted the analysis for our first research question, using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon post-hoc comparisons after finding ANOVA assumptions were violated. We found that songs released in January saw significantly higher Spotify streams, likely due to seasonal trends. Our findings offer insights for artists and marketers on how timing and platform strategy can shape a song’s success in today’s algorithm-driven music landscape.
