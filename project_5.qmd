In [*Altadena and the Eaton Fire*](https://arcg.is/0fDb4O){style="color: blue;"}, my team and I developed an interactive website using ArcGIS StoryMaps to examine the disproportionate impacts of the 2023 Eaton Fire on historically marginalized communities in Altadena, California. The first half of our project uses spatial data—including Cal Fire’s Damage Inspection (DINS) reports, HOLC redlining maps, and U.S. Census data—to investigate how redlining and discriminatory housing policies have shaped present-day vulnerability to wildfire damage. The second half shifts to a more human-centered narrative, examining the fire’s impact on Altadena’s cultural landscape through the loss of historic landmarks, small businesses, and individual homes, many tied to long-standing Black and Latinx families. Together, these stories and spatial patterns reveal how past and present injustices shape who bears the brunt of climate disasters.
