### About

Using a 2-way factorial design with interactions, I studied whether caffeine intake and exercise duration significantly impact attention span. Here is my written [**Report**](Stats101B_Final_Project.pdf){style="color: blue;"},

There were 9 experimental groups in total. The 2 factors each had 3 levels:

-   **Caffeine intake:** Green Tea (250mL), Coffee (250mL), Coffee (500mL)

-   **Running distance**: 100m, 1km, 5km

I used ANOVA to reveal whether caffeine intake, running distance, or their interaction had a statistically significant effect on attention span. I used Tukey's test to reveal whether any individual group differed significantly from the others.
